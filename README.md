# Sahayak

My comarade in developing iOS applications.


### How I came up with the title

`Sahayak` in Hindi means helper/assistant -- And that is what this project is going to be. This would be my go-to framework for all of my iOS related application development.

### Why `Sahayak`?

I felt like it is good to have all the stuff that you are using across the projects under the same hood. It helps with development easier.
